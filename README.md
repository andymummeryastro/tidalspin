# tidalspin
tidalspin: for constraining black hole spins using the properties of relativistic tidal forces. 

## Paper
This repository contains the bayesian model that was developed in [Mummery 2023](). 

A full mathematical description of the theory is contained in the paper. 

Please cite this paper if you use this code. 

## Code 
* The main program is contained in a python file ``tidalspin.py``
* Some examples of how to use this package are in ``examples.py``
* Running ``python3 tidalspin.py`` will reproduce Figure 10 of the paper.
